Note how Bon Jovi "bounces" when the button is tapped -- the image first shrinks, then expands outward (slightly past its final size), then comes to a rest at a height that fills the screen. When the image shrinks, it goes through the same process in reverse. This sort of multi-step animation is perfect for the keyframe animation methods in UIKit. Have fun!
